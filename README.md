# [Tetris Game for Midterm Exam]

## Author: Natalia Klimareva COM19-A

Tetris is a very popular block game that first started in the 80's.
The movement of the blocks is provided by pressing the arrow keys (right and left). The up arrow key rotates the shape, and the down arrow key resets it to the bottom of the window.

## At the picture below we can see the came window with figures and score:

## When the figures reach the top of the window, the game stops.
